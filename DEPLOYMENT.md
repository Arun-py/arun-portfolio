## 🔧 Post-Deployment Tasks

Visit your Vercel URL and test:
- [ ] Fire video background loads properly
- [ ] All pages navigate correctly (Home, About, Skills, Projects, Contact)
- [ ] Profile image displays
- [ ] Translucent cards with glow effects work
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Contact form (frontend only - backend needed for submissions)

### 2. Update Repository Description

On GitHub:
1. Go to `https://github.com/Arun-py/arun-portfolio`
2. Click **⚙️ Settings** (repository settings)
3. Update:
   - **Description:** `🌐 Personal Portfolio Website of Arun Thanigaimani — IoT & Embedded Systems Engineer and Front-End Developer. Built with React, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion.`
   - **Website:** Add your Vercel URL
   - **Topics:** Add tags like `portfolio`, `react`, `mern-stack`, `iot`, `frontend`, `vercel`

### 3. Custom Domain (Optional)

If you have a custom domain:

1. In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Domains
2. Add your domain (e.g., `arunthani.com`)
3. Update DNS records:
   ```

2. Enable Vercel Analytics

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment

**Auto-Deploy:** Every push to `main` branch triggers automatic deployment!

```bash
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update portfolio content"
git push origin main

# Vercel automatically rebuilds and deploys 🚀
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Video Not Loading
**Problem:** `blackhole.mp4` is large (11MB)

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Compress video with HandBrake/FFmpeg
- ✅ Use lower quality for web
- ✅ Add loading fallback
- ✅ Use CDN for video hosting (Cloudinary, etc.)

### Issue 2: Build Failed - Out of Memory
**Solution:** Optimize dependencies
```bash
# Remove unused dependencies
npm uninstall axios three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei
```

### Issue 3: Routes Not Working (404 on Refresh)
**Solution:** `vercel.json` already configured with:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }]
}
```

### Issue 4: Contact Form Not Working
**Note:** Frontend is deployed, but backend needs separate hosting.

**Options:**
1. Deploy backend to Render/Railway
2. Use serverless functions (Vercel Serverless)
3. Use form services like Formspree/EmailJS
